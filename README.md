# Quantum agents in the Gym: a variational quantum algorithm for deep Q-learning

This notebook provides an implementation of the deep Q-network algorithm with a parametrized quantum circuit as a function approximator.
It is an implementation of the algorithm introduced in the corresponding paper: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.15084.pdf
